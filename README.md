A perfect mix of [`Caddy`](https://github.com/mholt/caddy), [`docker-gen`](https://github.com/jwilder/docker-gen), and [`forego`](https://github.com/jwilder/forego). Inspired by [`nginx-proxy`](https://github.com/jwilder/nginx-proxy).

---

## Why

Using `Caddy` as your primary web server is super simple.
But when you need to scale your application Caddy is limited to its static configuration.

To overcome this issue we are using `docker-gen` to generate configuration everytime a container spawns or dies.
Now scaling is easy!

## CADDY 2

BREAKING CHANGES since [version 0.3.0](https://github.com/wemake-services/caddy-gen/releases/tag/0.3.0)!

Options to configure:

- `virtual.host` domain name, don't pass `http://` or `https://`. Multiple domains can be specified by separeating them with a space,
- `virtual.alias` domain alias, e.q. `www` prefix (this option is not compatible with specifiying multiple domains in the `virtual.host` label,
- `virtual.port` port exposed by container, e.g. `3000` for React apps in development,
- `virtual.tls-email` the email address to use for the ACME account managing the site's certificates,
- `virtual.auth.username` and
- `virtual.auth.password` together provide HTTP basic authentication.

Password should be a string `base64` encoded from `bcrypt` hash. You can use https://bcrypt-generator.com/ with default config and https://www.base64encode.org/.

## Backing up certificates

To backup certificates make a volume:

```yaml
services:
  caddy:
    volumes:
      - ./caddy-info:/data/caddy
```

## Usage

This image is created to be used in a single container.

```yaml
version: "3"
services:
  caddy-gen:
    container_name: caddy-gen
    image: "wemakeservices/caddy-gen:latest"
    restart: always
    volumes:
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/tmp/docker.sock:ro # needs socket to read events
      - ./caddy-info:/data/caddy # needs volume to back up certificates
    ports:
      - "80:80"
      - "443:443"
    depends_on:
      - whoami

  whoami: # this is your service
    image: "katacoda/docker-http-server:v2"
    labels:
      - "virtual.host=myapp.com" # your domain
      - "virtual.alias=www.myapp.com" # alias for your domain (optional)
      - "virtual.port=80" # exposed port of this container
      - "virtual.tls-email=admin@myapp.com" # ssl is now on
      - "virtual.auth.username=admin" # Optionally add http basic authentication
      - "virtual.auth.password=JDJ5JDEyJEJCdzJYM0pZaWtMUTR4UVBjTnRoUmVJeXQuOC84QTdMNi9ONnNlbDVRcHltbjV3ME1pd2pLCg==" # By specifying both username and password hash
```

Or see [`docker-compose.yml`](https://github.com/wemake-services/caddy-gen/blob/master/docker-compose.yml) example file.

## Configuration

`caddy-gen` is configured with [`labels`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/labels-custom-metadata/).

The main idea is simple.
Every labeled service exposes a `virtual.host` to be handled.
Then, every container represents a single `upstream` to serve requests.

There are several options to configure:

- `virtual.host` is basically a domain name or a list of domain names, see [`Caddy` docs](https://caddyserver.com/docs/proxy)
- `virtual.alias` (optional) domain alias, useful for `www` prefix with redirect. For example `www.myapp.com`. Alias will always redirect to the host above. Not compatible with specifying multiple domains.
- `virtual.port` exposed port of the container
- `virtual.tls-email` could be empty, unset or set to [valid email](https://caddyserver.com/docs/caddyfile/directives/tls)
- `virtual.tls` (alias of `virtual.tls-email`) could be empty, unset or set to a [valid set of tls directive value(s)](https://caddyserver.com/docs/caddyfile/directives/tls)
- `virtual.auth.username` when set, along with `virtual.auth.password`, http basic authentication is enabled
- `virtual.auth.password` needs to be specified, along with `virtual.auth.usernmae`, to enable http basic authentication

Note, that options should not differ for containers of a single service.

### Backing up certificates

To backup certificates make a volume:

```yaml
services:
  caddy:
    volumes:
      - ./caddy-info:/data/caddy
```

### Versions

This image supports two [build-time](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/build/#set-build-time-variables-build-arg) arguments:

- `FOREGO_VERSION` to change the current version of [`forego`](https://github.com/jwilder/forego/releases)
- `DOCKER_GEN_VERSION` to change the current version of [`docker-gen`](https://github.com/jwilder/docker-gen/releases)
